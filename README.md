This is a digital semen catalog for bulls. It enables a farmer to browse for a specific bull semen for artificial insemination(AI). The catalog contains bull cards that hold details for a speific bull name, image, desired traits, milk production from lineage, DOB, breed and the breeer. This MVP is tailored for a agri-input supplier to add new bull entry, delete a bull entry based on the availability and for a farmer to browse through the catalog.
